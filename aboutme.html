			<h3>My Family</h3>
			<p>I married my best friend in May 2023. His name is Sammy. Sammy loves anything outdoors, and he loves working equipment. His family owns a sawmill and he assists in running the business. We have a puppy, Biscuit, and a new little kitten, Blue Jean. My priority is my little family and I love them with all my heart.

				<li>crafting</li>
				<li>gardening</li>
