		<h2>Welcome!</h2>
		<p>	Welcome to my site! My name is <b>Chandler Maggard</b>. I am currently a teacher at <a href="https://www.laurel.kyschools.us/o/jes" target="_blank">Johnson Elementary</a> about to begin my <em>third</em> year. I am working on becoming a school library media specialist. I am so excited to continue working with kids. I look forward to helping students find books they enjoy, helping teachers find resources, and teaching good research/digital citizenship skills.

	<h2>Why I Wanted to Become a Librarian<h2>
	<p>		From an early age, I loved stories. I loved listening to them before bed, hearing them from my grandparents, and even making them up in my head. Thankfully, I had a <strong>FANTASTIC</strong> librarian in elementary school. She was a phenomenal storyteller, especially during Halloween. The stories I heard and the books I read were able to take me to a different world. I am thankful that she instilled sucha a love of reading for me and I hope to do the same one day.
